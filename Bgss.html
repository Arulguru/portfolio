	main goal of this interactive door is providing a smart door by which a
	caretaker for one or more blind people can communicate with them
	upon the person in need of care accessing the door. It also has built-
	in knock pattern-based door lock, room identification help in case of
	public buildings, reminder management, Check in check out time
	announcement . Here we use a low power microcontroller MSP430
	which is used in satellites since it could function even at low voltage
	in range about 1.4V. This provides a one way social network kind of
	environment by which a caretaker or a doctor can even be hired for
	the guidance and security to number of sight impaired people .
